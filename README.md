# ðŸŸ  Pang

**PANG** is a recreation of the classic arcade video game developed in **C++** using **OpenGL**. The game preserves the original mechanics: the player must **destroy all the bubbles** on the screen while avoiding being hit by them.  

This project is implemented with a **tile system** to manage the environment, handle collisions, and control bubble logic, combining 2D graphics with object-oriented programming. It was developed for the **Video Games (VJ) course at UPC FIB**, together with Joel Corredor Casares.  

## ðŸŽ® Key Features

- **Recreation of the classic PANG game** with bubble-shooting mechanics.  
- **Tile system** for efficient environment and collision management.  
- **Basic bubble physics**: bouncing, splitting, and dynamic behavior based on height and speed.  
- **Character control** with lateral movement and shooting, fully implemented from scratch.  

## ðŸš€ Technologies

- **Language:** C++  
- **Graphics:** OpenGL  
- **Platform:** PC
